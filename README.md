Puppy Bowl is a Fullstack assignment. This project focuses mainly on front-end skills with React v18. The assignment was cut for time and simplified to basically a single fetch call. It could be something much more some day, if I'm feeling not lazy - the site fetches from *[Puppy Bowl API](https://fsa-puppy-bowl.herokuapp.com/api/)*. I used the opportunity to learn about CSS animations and have some fun ðŸ’©
